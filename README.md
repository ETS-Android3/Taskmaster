##  For today's lab ,I  started to build an Android app that will be a main focus of the second half of the course: TaskMaster. While I started small today, over time this will grow to be a fully-featured application.

##  For today's lab ..
*  I updated the home page to use a RecyclerView for displaying Task data. This has hardcoded Task data for now. 
* I created a Task class. A Task should have a title, a body, and a state. The state should be one of “new”, “assigned”, “in progress”, or “complete”.
